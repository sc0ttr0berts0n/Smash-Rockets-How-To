To keep you rocket from falling off the platform, you can use the `Thrust at Attractor` key. Doing so draws you towards the attractor overhead.

### The Platform

The platform is all you have standing between yourself and the bottomless pit. Be careful to keep yourself on its top side, once you fall below, it is tough to get back up.

### The Opponent

While anyone other than you is your opponent, the opponent you target is marked with a crosshair over them. Press the `Fly at Opponent` Key to Smash them off the platform.

#### Enemy Assignment
Each player pursues one other player, and each player has one player pursuing them. Depending on the number of players, you will not necessarily be chasing the person chasing you.

#### Collisions
To defeat your opponent, you must knock him off the bottom of the screen. When two players collide, the faster player will send the slower player rocketing off the platform. So build up momentum with the `Fly at Opponent` Key and smash them off the platform.
